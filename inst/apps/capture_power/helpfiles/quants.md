# Quantiles of the Estimate Distribution

These are summary statistics for the simulated capture recapture estimates. For example if you have the following table:

% of estimates within  | % Accuracy  | Absolute Accuracy
--------------------- | ---------- | ------------------
50.00 | 16.94	| 1694.13
60.00	| 18.04	| 1804.44
70.00	| 23.39	| 2338.55
80.00	| 25.95	| 2595.40
90.00	| 32.37	| 3237.40
95.00	| 35.09	| 3508.78

We can interpret this by reading left to right. There is a 90% chance that the CRC study's population size estimate will be within 32.37% of the true value. There is a 90% chance that the study's estimate will be within 3508.78 of the true value.
