# # of Simulations
The application simulates capture recapture studies and reports the amount of variability in the estimates based on the posited population. The more simulations that are performed, the more accurately it is able to measure the uncertainty. However, large numbers of simulations can take considerable time.

It is suggested that you start off with a very small number (~10-20) until the all of the options are set how your would like. Then increase the number to be as large as is practical. Typically you will want this to be >500.
