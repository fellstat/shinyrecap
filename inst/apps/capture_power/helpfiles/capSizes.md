# Expected Capture Sample Sizes

These are the number of people you expect to recruit at each capture event. There are three capture events by default. Click the **Add** button to add more events to the study.

Adjust these sizes until an accepatable level variability is achieved in the estimate distribution. Alrger sample sizes will provide more accuracy and hence less variability. Unless there is a reason to do otherwise, it is usually a good idea to start with equal capture sizes for all events.
