# Heterogeneity Plot

This plot shows the distribution of capture likelihood among members of the population at each of the capture events. This plot will only display when the heterogeneity type is "Normal."

Use this plot to adjust the amount of heterogeneity that you are assuming. If there is too much variability, decrease the odds ratio closer to 0. If there is not enough, increase the odds ratio.
