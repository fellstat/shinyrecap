# Log-linear Diagnostic Plots

The top diagnostic plot should be linear except in the case of the Mth model, where it should be either linear or concave down.

The bottom plot should be linear in the case of the M0 model and concave down in the case of the Mh model. For the other model types it has no specified form.
