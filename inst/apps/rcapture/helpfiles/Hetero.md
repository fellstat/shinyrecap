# Heterogeneity

When heterogeneity is present, there are different forms that this heterogeneity can take.

* **Normal:** The log odds of capture follows a Normal distribution.
* **Darrosh:** The log odds of capture _among those who were not captured_ follows a Normal distribution.
* **Poisson:** The log odds of capture _among those who were not captured_ follows a Poisson distribution.
* **Gamma:** The log odds of capture _among those who were not captured_ follows a Gamma distribution.
