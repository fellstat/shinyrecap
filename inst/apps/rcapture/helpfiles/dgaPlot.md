# Posterior Plot

DGA outputs a distribution (called the posterior) for population sizes that are compatible with the data seen and the prior specified. The solid line is that distribution.

The posterior distribution is composed as the weighted average of the posteriors of a collection of models assuming different types of interactions between the capture events. The dotted lines indicate those distributions. The height of the dotted line distributions represent their contribution to the combined posterior distribution.
