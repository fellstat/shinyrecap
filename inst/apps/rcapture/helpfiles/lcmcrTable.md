# BLC Posterior Results

These are the model based estimated for population size. The algorithm outputs a distribution (called the posterior) for population sizes that are compatible with the data seen and the prior specified. This table provides summaries of that distribution.
* **Mean:** The point estimate for population size.
* **Median:** There is a 50% chance that the population size is greater than this and a 50% chance it is below.
* **95% Lower / Upper:** These are the bounds of the 95% probability interval. There is a 95% chance that the population size is between these numbers.
