# Pairwise Analysis Table

This table shows population estimates using each pair of capture events. It can be useful to look at this as a diagnostic step. Ideally each pair should have similar estimates of population size.

Each row is a separate two-source capture recapture analysis using only two of the capture events. For example, pa24 estimates the population size using only the 2nd and 4th capture events.

* **Population Size:** The estimated population size.
* **se:** The standard error of the estimate.
* **95% CI Upper/Lower:** 95% confidence intervals.
